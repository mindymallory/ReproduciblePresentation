## Reproducible research with R, RStudio, RMarkdown, Knitr, and Github

  + [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - is awesome statitstical computing software (open source and free!)  
  
  
  + [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - is an awesome integrated development environment (program making it convenient to work with R); also open source and free  


## Reproducible research with R, RStudio, RMarkdown, Knitr, and Github

  + [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a kind of markup language supported by RStudio that uses **Knitr** to weave statistical analysis and results into beautifully formatted documents.  
  
    + Written in plaintext, it understands latex code and documents can be rendered into many different output formats
        + PDF
        + Beamer
        + HTML
        + Word*
